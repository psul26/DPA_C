 *  The \b cop library, a software library dedicated to cooperative optimization

 *  \author Renaud Pacalet, renaud.pacalet@telecom-paristech.fr
 *  \date 2009-07-08
 *
 * The cooperative optimization algorithm implemented by the following functions
 * is based on the theory introduced by Xiaofei Huang (see, for instance,
 * "Cooperative Optimization for Energy Minimization: A Case Study of Stereo
 * Matching", in Pattern Recognition, 26th DAGM Symposium, Springer-Verlag, LNCS
 * 3175, 2004, pp. 302â€“309.
 * \attention
 * The number of agents must be between 1 and 64. Larger sets are not yet
 * supported.
