New version of the "reference" implementation
by Sebastien Beal, Thomas Chardin, and Thomas Deniau
====================================================

Changes from r24:

* Trace additions and DES processing are now natively
implemented using C++ and a bridge generated by SWIG.
* To compile these new files, we use the GNU Autotools.
* We now attack the second round as well ; unfortunately
twice as many traces are needed.

* This is still bugged. We don't recover the correct key yet :-)
