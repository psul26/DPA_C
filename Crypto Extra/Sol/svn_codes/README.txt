* Attack algorithm: CPA attacks using effective power trace.
* Description:      I implemented 3 different method, CPA using Pearson's correlation,
                    Spearman's rho and Kendall's tau. You might need to install statistics
                    toolbox in your Matlab, especially, Spearman's rho and Kendall's tau.
                    My implementation focused on the order of power trace that can have very
                    effective influence on the CPA result.

kasper:

Dear dpa-contest team,

recently we applied a new version of the stochastic approach [1,2]. The
latest results shows the practicability of the approach with a very
small number of traces (secmatv1). We know that the deadline recently
has elapsed, but we kindly want to ask you if it is still possible to
participate. We would be very grateful if we could contribute and take
part in the contest.

Additional benefits of our approach:

a) We get an explicit expression for the subkey-dependent part of the
leakage

b) even more important: The model assumes that the subkey dependent part
of the leakage does only depend on the sum (x\XOR k). If this symmetry
condition is at least approximately valid (the efficiency of the attack
seems to support this assumption) then the approximation function
h^*_{t_j,k^*}(\cdot,k^*) can be applied to other subkeys, too
(substituting k^* by k, keeping the coefficients) and covariance matrix
C=C(k^*).

1. Makes use of the relationship between the subkeys for the 1st and the 16th rounds.

Our method attacks part of both the 1st and the 16th rounds,
aiming to finally deduce more than 48 bits of the master key.
Note here that large part of the subkeys for the 1st and the 16th rounds
have the same secret information in common.
For instance, in the "Fixed order" scheme,
our attack extracts a candidate subkey for the S1
at the 16th round using CPA.
This key is denoted as {18 59 42 03 57 25}, where the digits are
from the bits of the master key (1:64).
In the second step, we extract a candidate subkey for the S2 at the 1st
round
using CPA. Same as above, this key is denoted as {33 63 02 09 19 42}.
Now the bit 42 is already fixed in the first step, we deduce the key
in the second step using the information.
In this example, the search space in the second step is 25 keys:
We can find a candidate key from a space half the size of that in the
ordinary CPA.
We continue the same procedure in the remaining steps, say,
deduce candidate keys using the constraints for subkeys.

In the ``Fixed order" scheme, the final search space is represented as
26+25+26+...+21+22.
It's noteworthy that the space is smaller than that in the ordinary
CPA, 8*26 (See below).

/***********************************************************************/
Sample Step for ``Fixed order"
/***********************************************************************/
Step 01 :TargetRound=16 | TargetSbox=1 | SearchSpace=26
Step 02 :TargetRound=01 | TargetSbox=2 | SearchSpace=25
Step 03 :TargetRound=01 | TargetSbox=1 | SearchSpace=26
Step 04 :TargetRound=01 | TargetSbox=8 | SearchSpace=26
Step 05 :TargetRound=16 | TargetSbox=4 | SearchSpace=23
Step 06 :TargetRound=16 | TargetSbox=5 | SearchSpace=24
Step 07 :TargetRound=01 | TargetSbox=6 | SearchSpace=23
Step 08 :TargetRound=16 | TargetSbox=7 | SearchSpace=24
Step 09 :TargetRound=16 | TargetSbox=6 | SearchSpace=23
Step 10 :TargetRound=16 | TargetSbox=8 | SearchSpace=24
Step 11 :TargetRound=01 | TargetSbox=3 | SearchSpace=21
Step 12 :TargetRound=01 | TargetSbox=5 | SearchSpace=21
Step 13 :TargetRound=01 | TargetSbox=7 | SearchSpace=22
48 bits of the master key is decided by the results
of the steps until here.

2. More precise modelling of the selection function

As the selection function, [1] uses the Hamming distance of the data
registers
connected to f-function.
In order for the selection function to model more precisely
the behaviour of the actual hardware,
we introduce two improvements shown below.

(1) The fanout from the E-function considered
The number of fanouts from the E-function of DES differs
from bit to bit: can be 1 for some bits and 2 for the others.
In our model, the registers whose fanout will be 2 are considered
to have a Hamming weight of 2, and Hamming distances are calculated
in accordance with that.

(2) The transition of the key register considered
The transition of the key register propagates to the logic circuits
for the S-boxes, which supposedly affects the power consumption
to a great extent.
With that considered, we bring the transition into the selection function
using the information of the candidate keys already analyzed.

Nonetheless, it should be mentioned that the attack of [1] can be
carried out
with ciphertexts and waveforms, while our attack needs the plaintexts in
addition.
